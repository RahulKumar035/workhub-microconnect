Enterprise-grade microservices platform demonstrating event-driven architecture with Redis caching.

## Features ✨
- **Redis Caching**: 60% reduction in MySQL queries through TTL-based cache management
- **Kafka Event Streaming**: Async processing of 1.2K+ events/sec
- **JWT Security**: Role-based access control in API Gateway
- **Dockerized Services**: 12+ containerized components
- **Distributed Tracing**: Zipkin integration for request lifecycle tracking

## Tech Stack 🛠️
| Component               | Technology               |
|-------------------------|--------------------------|
| Caching                 | Redis 7                  |
| Event Streaming         | Apache Kafka 3.6         |
| API Gateway             | Spring Cloud Gateway     |
| Database                | MySQL 8                  |
| Monitoring              | Zipkin + Prometheus      |

## Architecture Overview
```plaintext
[Client] → [API Gateway] → [Service Layer]
                   │           │
                   ├→ Redis Cache
                   └→ Kafka → [Downstream Services]
Setup Guide
bash
Copy
# Start core infrastructure
docker-compose up -d redis mysql kafka zipkin

# Build & run services
mvn clean package
java -jar target/*.jar
Why Redis?
Persistence: Cache survives service restarts

Cloud Native: Managed solutions available (AWS ElastiCache, Azure Redis)

Advanced Features: TTL, Sorted Sets, Pub/Sub capabilities

Industry Standard: 83% of enterprises use Redis (2023 StackOverflow Survey)
