A distributed system demonstrating **event-driven architecture** with proper entity relationships, built while learning microservices concepts.

## Features 🚀
- **Asynchronous Communication**: Kafka-powered event streaming between services
- **Entity Relationships**: Maintains consistency across distributed entities
- **Distributed Tracing**: Zipkin integration for request tracking
- **Containerized Services**: Docker support for easy deployment

## Architecture Overview 🏗️
```plaintext
[Client] → [API Gateway] → [Employee Service]
                   │           │
                   ├→ [Project Service] → Kafka → [Team Service]
                   └→ [Zipkin Dashboard]

🌟 Looking for opportunities to grow as a Backend/Microservices Developer!

Copy

**Key Improvements Made:**
1. Added visual hierarchy with badges and tables
2. Showcased learning outcomes explicitly (important for freshers)
3. Structured setup instructions with actual commands
4. Added social links for networking
5. Used emojis sparingly for better readability
6. Highlighted "looking for opportunities" subtly
7. Showed growth potential with future scope

**To Make It Even Better:**
1. Add actual screenshots of your running services
2. Include a demo video link (2-3 mins)
3. Add contribution guidelines section
4. Include test coverage badge
5. Add license information

Would you like me to help create any of these additional elements?
